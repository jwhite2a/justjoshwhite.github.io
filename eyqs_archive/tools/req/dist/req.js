  // invokeGuardedCallback uses a try-catch, all user exceptions are treated
  // like caught exceptions, and the DevTools won't pause unless the developer
  // takes the extra step of enabling pause on caught exceptions. This is
  // untintuitive, though, because even though React has caught the error, from
  // the developer's perspective, the error is uncaught.
  //
  // To preserve the expected "Pause on exceptions" behavior, we don't use a
  // try-catch in DEV. Instead, we synchronously dispatch a fake event to a fake
  // DOM node, and call the user-provided callback from inside an event handler
  // for that fake event. If the callback throws, the error is "captured" using
  // a global event handler. But because the error happens in a different
  // event loop context, it does not interrupt the normal program flow.
  // Effectively, this gives us try-catch behavior without actually using
  // try-catch. Neat!

  // Check that the browser supports the APIs we need to implement our special
  // DEV version of invokeGuardedCallback

/**
 * Summary of `ReactBrowserEventEmitter` event handling:
 *
 *  - Top-level delegation is used to trap most native browser events. This
 *    may only occur in the main thread and is the responsibility of
 *    ReactDOMEventListener, which is injected and can therefore support
 *    pluggable event sources. This is the only work that occurs in the main
 *    thread.
 *
 *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This
 *    may be done in the worker thread.
 *
 *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to
 *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want
 *    to extract any synthetic events.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with
 *    "dispatches", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.
 *
 *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.

 * We listen for bubbled touch events on the document object.

 * Firefox v8.01 (and possibly others) exhibited strange behavior when

 * contained within that mount point (for example on the background) the
 * top-level listeners for `onmousemove` won't be called. However, if you
 * register the `mousemove` on the document object, then it will of course

 * top-level listeners to the document object only, at least for these
 * movement types of events and possibly all events.
 *
 * @see http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/09/click_event_del.html

 * Also, `keyup`/`keypress`/`keydown` do not bubble to the window on IE, but

  /**
   * Collection of methods that allow declaration and validation of props that are
   * supplied to React components. Example usage:
   *
   *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');
   *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({
   *     propTypes: {
   *       // An optional string prop named "description".
   *       description: Props.string,
   *
   *       // A required enum prop named "category".
   *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,
   *
   *       // A prop named "dialog" that requires an instance of Dialog.
   *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired
   *     },
   *     render: function() { ... }
   *   });
   *
   * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:
   *
   *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)
   *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?
   *
   * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature. This
   * allows the creation of custom validation functions. For example:
   *
   *  var MyLink = React.createClass({
   *    propTypes: {
   *      // An optional string or URI prop named "href".
   *      href: function(props, propName, componentName) {
   *        var propValue = props[propName];
   *        if (propValue != null && typeof propValue !== 'string' &&
   *            !(propValue instanceof URI)) {
   *          return new Error(
   *            'Expected a string or an URI for ' + propName + ' in ' +
   *            componentName
   *          );
   *        }
   *      }
   *    },
   *    render: function() {...}
   *  });

// However, if we ever elect to use timers in Safari, the prevalent work-around
// is to add a scroll event listener that calls for a flush.
